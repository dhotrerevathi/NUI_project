# üñêÔ∏è $P Point-Cloud Gesture Recognizer
An enhanced implementation of the $P gesture recognizer algorithm for robust 2D gesture recognition.

## üåü Features
- **Shape Context Descriptors**: Capture global shape information for improved gesture discrimination
- **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**: Handle temporal variations in gesture execution
- **Multi-Template Support**: Store multiple versions of each gesture for natural variation handling
- **Scale and Position Invariant**: Recognize gestures regardless of size or location
- **Gesture Creator Tool**: GUI application for drawing and saving custom gestures. This would generate gesture file and corresponding event files as per the template.
  
## üß† $P Algorithm Overview
1. **Resampling**: Convert input to 64 equidistant points
   - Converts input gestures into a fixed number of points (64 in this implementation).
   - Ensures consistent representation regardless of input speed or sampling rate.
     
2. **Scaling & Translation**: Normalize to unit square and common origin
   - Scales gestures to a unit square.
   - Translates to a common origin (0,0).
   - Makes recognition scale and position invariant.
     
3. **Shape Context Computation**: Calculate rich shape descriptors
   - Computes a shape context descriptor for each point.
   - Captures the distribution of other points in log-polar space.
   - Provides a rich, discriminative representation of shape.
     
4. **DTW Matching**: Find optimal alignment between gesture and templates
   - Uses DTW to find optimal alignment between two shape context sequences.
   - Allows for non-linear temporal alignment, handling variations in gesture execution speed.


## üé® Gesture Creator Tool

Our new Gesture Creator Tool allows users to:

- Draw gestures using a simple GUI
- Save gestures in the correct format for training
- Automatically generate both gesture files and event files
- Append multiple examples of the same gesture to a single file
- Avoid duplicate event files for the same gesture


## üöÄ Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+

### Installation
Install the packages mentioned in the file "requirements.txt"

### File Format:
#### gesture file format (examples provided):
GestureName

BEGIN

x,y <- List of points, a point per line

‚Ä¶

x,y

END



#### event stream file format (examples provided):

MOUSEDOWN

x,y <- List of points, a point per line

MOUSEUP

RECOGNIZE <- When you see this, you should output the result. (In UI Specifically, avoid in command line)


### Usage

### For Creating gesture and event files:
1. Run the Gesture Creator Tool:
   ```
   python .\gesture_creator.py
   ```
2. Draw your gesture on the canvas

3. Click "Save Gesture" to save your drawn gesture

4. Choose a name for your gesture file

5. The tool will save or append to the gesture file and create an event file if it doesn't exist

Create as many different gestures you want. The more you build the training set, better would be the detecting capability of the $P Recognizer 


### For testing $P Recognizer:

1. Add a gesture template:
```
python .\pdollar.py -t <path_to_gesture_file>
```

2. Upload an event file to recognize a gesture:
```
python .\pdollar.py <path_to_event_file>
```

3. Clear all templates
```
python .\pdollar.py -r
```


#### Example Run:
> python .\pdollar.py -r                                                                                               
All templates cleared

> python .\pdollar.py -t "<path_to_gesture_file>"     
Added template: arrowhead (Version 1)
Added template: arrowhead (Version 2)

> python .\pdollar.py "<path_to_event_file>"
Recognized gesture: arrowhead


## üìä Performance
The enhanced $P recognizer shows improved accuracy over the original algorithm, especially for:
- Similar looking gestures (e.g., 'arrowhead' vs 'five_point_star' vs 'exclamation_mark')


## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Recognizer (future aspects)
- **Rotation Invariance**: Implement circular shift matching of shape contexts
- **Multi-Stroke Support**: Extend to handle complex, multi-stroke gestures
- **User Adaptation**: Implement online learning for personalized recognition
- **GUI Interface**: Develop real-time input and recognition interface
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Extend beyond Windows OS
